# Pouiiro’s dotfiles for MACOS (you could re-use most things for other OSs)

## About

I began my journey to learn NVIM and i figured i'd build a setup from scratch that feels the most comfortable for me while also maintaining
good aesthetics & performance, i introduce you LazyPouiiro, a NVIM setup mainly optimized for web dev for Typescript & eslint-prettier, it should be
easy to customize for Biome as well and other environments!

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk! Although there is nothing risky to use -> _wink_

### Using Git

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.)

- -> Before anything, make sure to backup your old settings if there is any
- -> Also take a look at the keybindings especially in Nvim ;)

#### Necessary things

- -> Kitty terminal
- -> Neovim
- -> Lazyvim
- -> SKHD
- -> Yabai
- -> Karabiner
- -> Macchina CLI
- -> Nerd Fonts (specifically IOSVEKA)

(maybe i am missing something else, please open a PR if you encounter any issue!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pouiiro/dotfiles.git ~/.config/
