-- like this one:
-- NOTE: nixCats: this just gives nixCats global command a default value
-- so that it doesnt throw an error if you didnt install via nix.
-- usage of both this setup and the nixCats command is optional,
-- but it is very useful for passing info from nix to lua so you will likely use it at least once.

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)

-- Set to true if you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in the terminal
-- NOTE: nixCats: we asked nix if we have it instead of setting it here.
-- because nix is more likely to know if we have a nerd font or not.
